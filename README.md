# Collection Rebuild
Refactor of Collection FE App

**READ**

- Before creating a new folder, you must consult on the group with Andi :-)
- The correct formatting of a .tsx file is like the original page.tsx within the app folder: (Pay special attention to simple trailing commas)
```js
import React from 'react'

export const Home = () => {
  return (
    <></>
  )
}
```

- Before adding a new library, you must consult on the group first

Good luck :-)
